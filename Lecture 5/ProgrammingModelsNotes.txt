Models: Deterministic vs. Stochastic, Continuous vs. Discrete, Static vs. Dynamic

Deterministic Model:
 * Philosophy: all future states of a physical system can be derived from knowledge about current state
 * Given a fixed set of inputs, the model always gives the same output
 
Stochastic Model:
 * Philosophy: the future state of a system could depend on both the previous states and some random element
 * Regardless of identical inputs, the model's output can vary from instance to instance
 
Discrete Model:
 * The variables in the model are characterized by jumps and distinct values

Continuous Model:
 * The variables in the model hold an infinite number of potential values in any fixed interval
 
Static Model:
 * Captures a single moment in time along some process

Dynamic Model:
 * Highlights the evolution of the process itself, describing movement from state to state
