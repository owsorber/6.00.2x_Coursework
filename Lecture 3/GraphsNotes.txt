This file contains my own personal notes about segment 1 of Lecture 3, "Graphs".

A Graph is a set of Nodes.
  * Node (vertex): has properties associated with it (ex: a node that represents a city may have demographics as properties)
  * Edge (arc): connects a pair of nodes
      * Can be unweighted or weighted
  * Undirected Graph (graph): connection between nodes is symmetric (ex: Facebook friends)
  * Directed Graph (digraph): connection is asymmetric, goes from one node to the other (ex: search trees)

Google Maps Example:
  * Digraph
  * Nodes are points where roads meet/end (ex: intersections)
  * Edges are connections between these points
      * Edges are weighted by the time it takes to get between source node and destination node
  * Solves for shortest weighted path between two locations
