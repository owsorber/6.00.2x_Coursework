## MIT 6.00.2x Coursework
My coursework for MIT's Course 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (which I am taking through edX).

This repository includes problem sets, assigments, projects, and other miscellaneous Python files that I'm completing throughout the duration of the course.

## Organization
Repositories that include lesson code, assignments/exercises, and lecture-specific projects are placed into different folders based on Lecture. There is one folder for each Problem Set which includes each file involved in the pset's solution(s).

## Personal Projects For Each Lecture
* Lecture 2: Staircase of N Steps
* Lecture 3: Maze Solver
