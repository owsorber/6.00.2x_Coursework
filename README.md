## 6.00.2x Coursework
My coursework for MIT's Course 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (which I took through edX).

This repository includes problem sets, assigments, projects, and other miscellaneous Python files that I'm completing throughout the duration of the course.
